# Theseus and the Minotaur

This is a puzzle/maze game implemented in Unity.

The idea is to get Theseus to the exit without him being caught by the Minotaur. For each move that Theseus makes, the Minotaur makes two moves. The Minotaur always tries to get closer to Theseus, but prefers horizontal move over vertical.

The proudest part of the project revolves around the development of [this](https://github.com/vyshnovka/athens-maze/blob/main/Assets/Editor/LevelBuilder.cs) editor tool tailored specifically for level creation. Just place walls and entities where you like in the scene and save to a premade scriptable object (btw, level frame is drawn automatically).
